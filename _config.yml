  I got a PhD of linguistics from [Rice University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University) and spent most my early career in academia working on indigenous languages of Taiwan, all of which related to languages such as Tagalog and Malay/Indonesian. Then along came COVID-19, which interrupted most people lives, including mine. Somehow I became a machine learning engineer, working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI-related stuff. In the profile picture is my pet dog. She is the best dog ever!
